# Container With Most Water

## Problem

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i`th line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Constraints

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`

## Examples

| Input | Output |
|---|---|
| `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]` | `49` |
| `height = [1,1]` | `1` |

## Approach

Two pointers — start at both ends, move the shorter pointer inward, track the maximum area seen.

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
